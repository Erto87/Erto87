<summary><h3>Title: Animal Game https://play.unity.com/mg/other/build-6ic</h3><img alt="AnimalGame" width="500px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erto87/Erto87/main/AnimalGame.png"/></summary>

What is it?
The project is a 2D top-down action game played as an animal, showcasing the life of the animal with information about it. It will be a browser game.

Gameplay mechanics
The player chooses a continent with an animal on the world map. After that, the player gets to play as the animal in a top-down view, gathering food and avoiding dangers until reaching the finish line.

The maps are freeroam areas.

The player will find information "pop-ups" in the form of signs, providing details about the playable animal, its environment, and the threats it faces. At the end of each level, there will be a quiz based on the information pop-ups. Points are awarded for correct quiz answers.

The quiz will be located at the center of the map and won't allow the player to answer it if they haven't found all the information pop-ups. It will notify how many are still missing.

The player moves by WASD.

Enemies will patrol the level, attacking the player if they get close enough.

Food pickups heal the player.
Art style
The art style will be cartoon-like, with large colorful assets to appeal to children. The character art will be in a top-down perspective, while the environmental art will be partially top-down and partially side view.
